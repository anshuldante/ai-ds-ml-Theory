* Ambiguity is to have more than one answers or to have more than one solutions.
* Contacts could mean contact lenses or phone contacts, hence it's an ambiguous term.
* More daily life examples can be: tall, short, old, beautiful.
* The ability to think only in absolutes is called the "Law of Excluded Middles".
* Binary logic upholds this law.
* Fuzziness, ambiguity, incomplete, imprecision, randomness.
* incomplete: lack of understanding due to lack of info.
* imprecision: there may be errors or noise in the data.
* Randomness: an accident which can be calculated with probability.
* The biggest usage of fuzzy logic is Information Retrieval or data search.
* Recall: is the percentage of relevant documents retrieved vs the total of all documents retrieved.
* Precision: is the percentage of relevant documents retrieved vs the total relevant documents.
* High precision generally means a low recall.
* High recall would mean low precision:
  a. if you get a lot of returns from a search, your precision is probably low.
  b. As we add more and more keywords, we get higher precision and low recall.
  c. With broader searches, we have higher recall but lower precision and that the results have fewer similarities.
* Fuzzy inference: we use what we know about something to predict what we don't know or to get new data about it.
* Neural networks and genetic algorithms are the most commonly used for building fuzzy logic systems.
